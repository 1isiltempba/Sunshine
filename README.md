 Selena Quintanilla Dreaming of You Album Download     
If you are a fan of Selena Quintanilla, the late American Tejano singer, you might be interested in downloading her fifth and final studio album, **Dreaming of You**. This album was released posthumously on July 18, 1995, by EMI Latin and EMI Records, and it was an immediate commercial and critical success, debuting atop the United States Billboard 200—the first predominately Spanish-language album to do so. It sold 175,000 copies on its first day of release in the U.S.—a then-record for a female vocalist. With first week sales of 331,000 units, it became the second-highest first-week sales for a female musician since Nielsen Soundscan began monitoring album sales in 1991. **Billboard** magazine declared it a "historic" event, while **Time** said the recording elevated Selena's music to a wider audience. It won Album of the Year at the 1996 Tejano Music Awards and Female Pop Album of the Year at the 3rd annual Billboard Latin Music Awards.
     
The album contains some previously released material, as well as some unreleased English and Spanish-language tracks that were recorded between 1992 and 1995. The tracks are a mixture of American pop and Latin music, with the first half of **Dreaming of You** containing English-language R&B and pop ballads, while the latter half profiles Selena's Latin-themed repertoire, making this her only album to feature English-language songs instead of exclusively Spanish-language songs as with her past four albums. Six tracks from the album were released as singles. The first four singles, "I Could Fall in Love", "Tú Sólo Tú", "Techno Cumbia", and "Dreaming of You", charted within the top ten on the U.S. charts. The title track became Selena's highest-charting Billboard Hot 100 single of her career, peaking at number twenty-two.
